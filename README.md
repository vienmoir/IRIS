Inflorescence Recognition Intelligence System
This repository contains code for training a neural network based on VGG-16 for inflorescence image classification.
The collected dataset (not published due to its size) contains 2000 images of inflorescences of 10 tree species
growing in St. Petersburg, Russia.
The accuracy obtained on the testing set is ~93% after 200 epochs of training. 
Based on this model, a Telegram bot was created for instant tree recognition.
The code for the network is based on the tutorial by Adrian Rosebrock published on https://www.pyimagesearch.com
